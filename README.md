# HE_CHALLENGES

##First Challenge
Used Neural Networks with multiple hidden layers

Approach:
1. Acknowledged all entries that were factors(e.g. in Gender Column, Hometown Column, etc.), and 
changed their values to 'numerics' so we can use values in our linear model.

2. Missing 'cells' or entries I filled with mean of the columns.

3. Finally, I used the neural network to predict the values from the test data.  

4. Other `.py` files have stacked and boosted ML models.
